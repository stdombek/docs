The Receiving app allows you to indicate that materials ordered through the creation of purchase order lines in the Orders app have been received by the library. You can open the app directly from the FOLIO app bar or from the Orders app by clicking **Receive** on the action menu of an order that has an **Open** or **Closed** status.


Definition of terms related to the Receiving app:



*   **Package.** A purchase order that represents the acquisition of multiple titles. 
*   **Piece.** A subsection of a receiving title that is expected to be received. For example, if the ordered title is a journal subscription, then a piece of that title could be volume one of the journal.
*   **Receive.** To confirm that an all or part of an order has been delivered to the library.
*   **Receiving title.** The title of the ordered material. There may be one or more pieces attached.
*   **Unreceive.** To indicate that an order previously listed as “received” has not been delivered to the library.


## Permissions

The permissions listed below allow you to interact with the Receiving app and determine what you can or cannot do within the app. You can assign permissions to users in the Users app. If none of these permissions are assigned to a user, they are unable to see the Receiving app or any related information.



*   **Receiving: Assign acquisition units to new receiving title.** This permission allows the user to apply an acquisition unit to a new title created in the Receiving app.
*   **Receiving: Export search results.** This permission allows the user to export receiving search results in .csv format.
*   **Receiving: Manage acquisition units.** This permission allows the user to add or update acquisition units on receiving records that may have been inherited from corresponding order records.
*   **Receiving: View.** This permission allows the user to view receiving information for orders.
*   **Receiving: View, edit.** This permission allows the user to receive and edit pieces that are associated with a purchase order line.

## Keyboard shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts allow you to perform actions in this app using the keyboard.  See [Platform essentials > Keyboard shortcuts](../../platform-essentials/keyboard-shortcuts/keyboardshortcuts/) for more information.



## Creating a receiving title

Usually, an order consists of a receiving title that may have one or more pieces attached. For example, if you order a journal, the receiving title would be the journal name and the attached pieces would include each issue of the journal.

Purchase order lines can also be used to represent Packages. A package order line is created in the Orders app as a single purchase order line, but it can’t be located or received in the Receiving app because it represents the acquisition of multiple titles (for example, a monographic standing order). In order to receive the titles that are included in a package, you must either [add the titles to the purchase order line](../orders/#adding-package-titles-to-an-order-line) or create the receiving titles in the Receiving app and link them to the Package POL.

The **New** action allows you to create the receiving titles that come in a package so that they can be received by the library. This action also allows you to link existing instances to a package POL if you want to create a relationship between the instance and the order. In this case, the receiving title is searchable by its related POL number.



1. Click **Actions > New**.
2. In the **New title** window, in the **PO line details** section, click **POL number look-up**. 
3. In the **Select order lines** dialog, in the **Search & filter** box, enter the Package POL number.
4. Optional: Filter results using the filters in the **Select order lines** dialog.
5. Click **Search** and select the Package from the Search results. The Package POL is linked to the new title. 
6. Enter a **Title** for the item in the Package. 
7. Fill in the rest of the fields under Item details and PO line details. For more information on the fields and actions available in these sections, see the section descriptions below.
8. Click **Save & close**. A confirmation message appears, and the new receiving title is created and appears in the Receiving pane. It can now be edited, expected pieces can be added to it, and it can be received. You can locate the title by searching for the PO or POL number, the Package Name, the Title(s). 


### Item details



*   **Title.** The title of the material to be received. Note: For non-package POLs the receiving title is created automatically. For Package POLs you can use the **Title look-up** to link a pre-existing inventory instance to the Package POL or you may add a title manually by entering it in the text field. If manually adding a title, the Inventory record(s) will be created according to the **Create inventory** setting on the POL after the first piece is added to the receiving title. You will see the title appear in the **Package titles** accordionon the POL.

4. Fill out the desired fields.
5. Click **Save & close.** A confirmation message appears and the receiving title is updated.


### Title look-up

The **Title look-up** function replaces the current title with a title that already exists as an instance in Inventory. This doesn't replace existing publishing or subscription details, but it does add any contributors or product IDs associated with the new title. Once you make this change, the material is no longer searchable by the original title.



1. Click **Title look-up**.

## Adding an expected piece

An expected piece is a part of an order you expect to receive. For example, if you order a monthly magazine subscription, you might expect to receive 12 different pieces during the year. If you order a book that comes with supplemental materials such as a CD or map, you might expect to receive multiple pieces with the order. 

The **Receiving workflow** selected on the purchase order line determines the behavior of expected pieces. When the **Receiving workflow** is set to 'Synchronized order and receipt quantity', as soon as the order is opened, the Receiving app will automatically create pieces to match the quantity on the purchase order line. Additional pieces may be added to the receiving title, but this will increase the quantity on the purchase order line and may impact the estimated cost of that line and any related encumbrances. A red warning displays on these receiving titles to alert staff users to this behavior.

When the **Receiving workflow** is set to 'Independent order and receipt quantity', as soon as the order is opened, no pieces will be created automatically. A staff user can create any necessary pieces and this will not impact the quantity specified on the purchase order line.

Expected pieces can be found  in the Expected section of a Receiving app record. Expected pieces can also be received from this section. See [Quick receive](#quick-receive) for more information.

1. Find the receiving title to which you want to add a piece and select it.
2. In the **Expected** section, click **Actions**.  In the action menu, select **Add piece**.
3. Add information about the piece in the **Add piece** dialog. See below for more information about each field.
4. To add another piece after saving or quick receiving this piece, click the dropdown next to **Save & close** and select **Save and create another**. After you save & close or quick receive, the **Add piece** dialog form is populated with details from the previous piece form. 
5. To save and receive the piece simultaneously, click the dropdown next to **Save & close** and select **Quick receive**.  The new piece is saved and listed in the Received section.
6. To save without adding another piece, Click **Save & close**. The new piece is saved and listed in the Expected section.

### Piece details


*   **Display summary.** A description of a piece that can be used for public display. If this field is added/updated, the value displays on the corresponding field in the item record. Note: in previous releases, this field was labeled **Caption**.
*   **Copy number.** The copy number of the piece. If this field is added/updated, the value displays on the corresponding field in the item record.
*   **Enumeration.** The enumeration of the piece which indicates the sequential numeric and/or alphabetic designation used by a publisher to identify the individual bibliographic or physical parts and to show the relationship of each part to the bibliographic unit as a whole. If this field is added/updated, the value displays on the corresponding field in the item record.

This option is only available for pieces linked to an order with the purchase order line **Create inventory** value set to “Instance, holdings, item.” . Note: In order to create an item in Inventory, a default instance status, instance type, and loan type must already be set up in Settings.  See [Settings > Orders](../../settings/settings_orders/settings_orders/) for more information.
*   **Supplement.** Select the **Supplement** checkbox to indicate that the piece is supplementary material such as a CD or a map. 
*   **Display on holdings.**  Select the **Display on holdings** checkbox to indicate that information about this piece should be displayed in the Inventory app in the Acquisition section of the holdings record.  See [Inventory > Acquisition](../../inventory/#acquisition) for more information.

## Receiving a piece

Receiving a piece confirms that the ordered material arrived at the library. If an item record was created as a result of the corresponding POL's **Create inventory** setting, the act of receiving the corresponding piece(s) will also update the item record(s). A major update is to the item's status, which will transition from 'On order' to 'In process'. Once the item processing has concluded, a staff member should check the item in using the **Check in** app to complete the technical services workflow. This will check for any open requests on the item or update the item status to 'Available' if the material is not needed to fill a request.

There are two ways to receive a piece:

*   Quick Receive
*   Receive


### Quick receive

Quick receive can be used when you want to receive one piece of an order at a time.



1. Using the **Search & filter** pane, find the receiving title from which you want to receive pieces and select it.
2. In the Expected section of the order, click on the piece you want to receive. 
3. In the **Edit piece** dialog, make any necessary edits to the piece.
4. Click the dropdown next to **Save & close** and select **Quick receive**. The piece is now displayed under the Received section. 


### Receive

The Receive function can be used to receive multiple pieces at once. 



1. Using the **Search & filter** pane, find the receiving title you want to receive and select it.
2. In the Expected section of the receiving title, click the **Actions** button and select **Receive**.
3. A receiving note popup window will display if the purchase order line field **[Must acknowledge receiving note](../orders/#item-details)** is checked.  Click **Continue** to close the popup window.
4. In the receiving title window, all of the expected pieces are displayed. Here, you can make changes to the pieces. See below for more information.
5. Select the checkbox beside each piece you want to receive. Note: If you want to receive all of the pieces, click the top checkbox.
6. Click **Receive**. The selected pieces are now displayed under the Received section.


#### Receiving screen

*   **Supplement.** Select the **Supplement** checkbox to indicate that the piece is supplementary material such as a CD or a map. 

## Routing pieces
This applies only to receiving records where the corresponding purchase order line has an order format of 'Physical resource' or 'P/E mix'. Routing in FOLIO allows libraries to divert received materials away from the normal receiving process and workflow, to direct the materials to alternate locations for pre-circulation distribution or other special handling. Routing lists are configured in [Settings > Orders > Routing](../../settings/settings_orders/settings_orders/#settings--orders--routing--list-configuration). One routing lists may be configured per physical piece on a purchase order line. If a purchase order line has [routing lists configured](../orders/#routing-lists), the receiving title will show an indicator that the title has routing. The receiving title will contain a section labeled **Routing lists** that will be expanded by default.

### Adding routing lists
1. In the **Routing lists** section, click **Actions > Add routing list**.
2. Enter a Name for the routing list.
3. Optional: Add any Notes to the routing list.
4. Click Add users to launch a search modal for the Users app.
5. Select the user(s) to assign to the routing list and click Save.
6. Use the six dots icon in the left column of the Users table to establish the order in which the material should be routed.
7. Click Save & close.

### Printing routing lists
1. In the **Routing lists** section, click **Actions > Print all routing lists**.
2. This will launch the browser's print preview containing the information templated when the routing list was configured.
3. Print or save, as needed.

## Binding and unbinding pieces

## Unreceiving an piece

1. In the Received section of the receiving title, click **Actions**.  In the action menu, select **Unreceive.**
2. In the receiving title window, all of the received pieces are displayed in a table list containing barcode, display summary, enumeration, piece format, request, comment, select location, and call number. 
3. Optional: Make changes to the **Comment** field.
4. Select the checkbox beside each piece you want to unreceive. Note: If you want to unreceive all of the received pieces, select the top checkbox.
5. Click **Unreceive**. The selected pieces are now displayed under the Expected section.

## Marking a piece unreceivable
If a piece will not arrive at the library (e.g. the title is out of print) and will never be received by the library, use the following steps to mark the piece unreceivable:
1. Using the **Search & filter** pane, find the receiving title you want to mark unreceivable and select it.
2. In the Expected section of the receiving title, click on the piece.
3. The **Edit piece** modal will appear.
4. Click on the dropdown menu next to **Save & close** and select **Unreceivable**.
5. The piece status will update to 'Unreceivable' and the piece will move to the **Unreceiveable** accordion on the receiving record.

Note: if this action is performed in error or the piece becomes receivable, you can click on the piece in the **Unreceivable** accordion and, in the **Edit piece** modal, click on the dropdown menu next to **Save & close** and select **Expect**. This will move the piece back to the **Expected** accordion and update the piece status accordingly.

## Claiming a piece
If a piece has not arrived from the vendor by the expected receipt date or is damaged/unacceptable upon arrival, the library may wish to file a claim with the vendor to seek replacement or a refund. 

A library may configure a **Claiming interval** on the Organization record for the vendor. A **Claiming interval** represents the number of days after a piece's **Expected receipt date** when an unreceived piece will be marked **Late**. If a **Claiming interval** is entered on the Organization record, this will appear as the default claiming interval on purchase order lines associated with the vendor, but the default may be changed when the **Claiming active** box is checked on the purchase order line. The interval may also be changed on each receiving title; for example, if a package POL has mutliple titles that should each have different claiming intervals assigned.

Once a piece is marked **Late**, a library may wish to send a claim to the vendor. In the Quesnelia release of FOLIO, pieces can be marked as **Claim sent**, but automatic transmission to the vendor is not yet implemented. A library may wish to filter by **Receiving status** and use the **Export results (CSV)** option to send information to their vendor to support the claim.

To update a piece to 'Claim sent', use the following steps:
1. Using the **Search & filter** pane, find the receiving title for which you want to send a claim and select it.
2. In the Expected section of the receiving title, click on the piece.
3. The **Edit piece** modal will appear.
4. Click on the dropdown menu next to **Save & close** and select **Send claim**.
5. In the **Send claim** modal, enter a **Claim expiry date**. This is the date by which the claim needs to be resolved. If the piece status is not resolved before that date, the piece status will update back to **Late** to facilitate subsequent claims.
6. Optional: add internal and external notes, if desired.
7. Click **Save & close**.
8. The piece status will update to 'Claim sent' and remain in the **Expected** accordion on the receiving record.


If a library knows they must wait for a longer period of time before submitting a claim to a vendor, they may update a piece to delay the claim:
1. Using the **Search & filter** pane, find the receiving title for which you want to send delay a claim and select it.
2. In the Expected section of the receiving title, click on the piece.
3. The **Edit piece** modal will appear.
4. Click on the dropdown menu next to **Save & close** and select **Delay claim**.
5. In the **Delay piece** modal, enter a **Delay to** date.
6. Click **Save & close**.
7. The piece status will update to 'Claim delayed' and remain in the **Expected** accordion on the receiving record.
Note: When the delay date has passed, the piece status reverts to 'Late' or 'Expected' depending on the expected receipt date and the claiming interval for the receiving title. If the status of the piece has already been changed to 'Received' or 'Unreceivable', the status will not update after the delad date has passed.

## Viewing a piece's status log
The status of a piece can update when any of the following actions occur:
*  The piece is created.
*  The piece is received.
*  The piece is unreceived.
*  The piece has not been received and it is past its expected receipt date.
*  A claim is sent or delayed for the piece, which has not been received by the library.

These status changes are tracked and can be reviewed in the piece record's status log. To access the status log:
1. Using the **Search & filter** pane, find the receiving title and select it.
2. Click on the piece.
3. The **Edit piece** modal will appear.
4. Expand the **Status log** accordion at the bottom of the piece.
5. A table will appear with the following columns:
*  **Status change.** The status of the piece.
*  **Date.** The date the status change occurred.
*  **Interval.** This column only holds data for **Send claim** and **Delay claim** updates.
*  **Updated by.** The name of the user who made the update.
