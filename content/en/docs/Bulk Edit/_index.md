The Bulk Edit app allows a user to apply changes to multiple FOLIO records simultaneously. 


Bulk edit can apply changes to these record types:


* [**Inventory - holdings**](#inventory---holdings)
* [**Inventory - instances**](#inventory---instances)
* [**Inventory - items**](#inventory---items)
* [**Users**](#users)

For more information about record types in the Inventory app, see [Metadata \> Inventory](../metadata/inventory/_index.md).

For more information about user records, see [Users \> View a user record](../users/#view-a-user-record).

## Permissions


The permissions listed below allow you to interact with the Bulk Edit app and determine what you can or cannot do within the app. Permissions are assigned to users in the Users app. If none of these permissions are assigned to a user, they are unable to see the Bulk Edit app or any related information. 


Bulk edit permissions, combined with other functional app permissions, allow a user to access specific areas of the Bulk Edit app. Depending on how your library runs bulk edit jobs, users may also need permissions in other modules, such as Export Manager, Inventory, Users, and Settings. For more information about permissions, see [Platform Essentials \> Permissions](../platform-essentials/permissions). 


The following are the permissions for the Bulk edit app:


- **Bulk edit: In App - Edit user records.** This permission allows the user to edit multiple user records in the Bulk Edit app. 
- **Bulk edit: Can build query**: This permission allows the user to build and test a query, and preview matched records in the Bulk edit app. 
- **Bulk edit: Can view logs** This permission allows the user to download and view logs in the Bulk Edit app.
- **Bulk edit: In app - Edit inventory records** This permission allows the user to edit a field in multiple inventory records in the Bulk Edit app. 
- **Bulk edit: In app - View inventory records** This permission allows the user to view a list of inventory records in the Bulk Edit app. 
- **Bulk edit: Local - Edit user records** This permission allows the user to edit a field in multiple user records in Bulk Edit using the CSV approach.
- **Bulk edit: Local - View user records** This permission allows the user to view a list of identified user records in Bulk Edit using the CSV approach.


## Identify records for bulk edit

The Bulk edit app provides two methods for identifying records: 

### Identifier

The **Identifier** approach allows the user to set criteria for the bulk edit by uploading a list of record identifiers from a .csv file. Only .csv files containing one column of record identifiers are accepted for upload in the Bulk edit app. If the .csv file contains more than one column, the upload will not be successful and a *Something went wrong* message displays. 

To set criteria for bulk edit using **Identifier**, follow these steps: 

1. In the **Set Criteria** pane, select the **Identifier** button.
2. Select the **Record type**.
3. Select the **Record identifier** from the **Select record identifier** drop-down menu. Record identifiers available for selection are based on the Record type.
4. **Drag and drop** your .csv file into the **Select a file with record identifiers** box, or click **or choose file** to upload the .csv file from your computer.

If the **Identifier** method is used to identify records for bulk edit, the number of records matched and the filename display at the top of the **Bulk edit** modal. 

### Query

The **Query** function in the Bulk Edit app allows the user to build a query to identify records for bulk edit. 

To set criteria for bulk edit using **Query**, follow these steps: 

1. In the **Set Criteria** pane, click on the **Query** tab.
2. Select the **Record type**.
3. Click the **Build query** button to open the **Build query** modal.
4. Select a **Field** from the *Select field* drop-down menu or filter the selection by typing the field in the *Filter options list* text box.
5. Select an **Operator** from the *Select operator* drop-down list. The operators available for selection are based on the **Field**. 

 - ==: Field equals selected or input Value.
 - !=:  Field does not equal selected or input Value.
 - Contains: Field appears in selected or input Value.
 - Starts: Field starts with selected or input Value.
 - >: Field is greater than the selected or input Value.
 - <: Field is less than the selected or input Value.
 - >=: Field is greater than or equal to the selected or input Value.
 - <=: Field is less than or equal to the selected or input Value.
 - Is null/empty: Field is blank; it contains no data.

6. Select a **Value** from the *Select value* drop-down list or type the value in the text box.  The Values available for selection are based on the **Field** and **Operator**.
7. Click on the **+ icon** to add additional lines to the query; Click on the **trash can icon** to delete a line from the query.
8. Once a query is built, it must be tested before the query can be run and saved. Click the **Test query** button to run the query and display a preview of matched records. The query string can be edited in the **Query string** field. If edited, another Test query must be done.
9. If the Test query is successful, click the **Run query** button to run the query and preview the matched records in the **Bulk edit query** modal.

## Preview matched records

If the **Identifier** method is used to identify records for bulk edit, the number of records matched and the filename display at the top of the **Bulk edit** modal. 

If the **Query** method is used to identify records for bulk edit, a **Test query** displays the Query string and number of records retrieved at the top of the **Build query** modal. 

If the query is run, the **Query** and a preview of matched records display in the **Bulk edit query** modal. 

To add or remove record identifier columns in the preview pane, click the **Actions** button. 
- In the **Show columns** section of the Actions menu, check the box next to the name of the record identifier to include as a column in the preview.
- Uncheck the box next to the name of the record identifier to remove the column from the preview.

## Download matched records

If desired, download the matched records as a .csv file:
1. In the **Preview** pane, click **Actions** and select **Download matched records (CSV)**.
2. Depending on the web browser settings, the .csv file may be opened and/or saved. 

## Download errors

If there are errors in the matched records, a message indicating the filename, number of entries, number of records matched, and number of errors displays in a two-column table in the **Errors** section. 

**Record identifier.** The record identifier for the records that produced the error.
**Reason for error.** The reason why the error was produced.

To download the errors as a .csv file:

### Identify records


The Bulk Edit app accepts only .csv files for editing record identifiers in a record. The .csv file used to set criteria must include only one column of record identifiers. 

The Bulk Edit app accepts only .csv files for identifying records. The .csv file used to set criteria must include only one column of record identifiers. 

There are two methods for identifying records for Bulk edit: **Identifier** and **Query**. 

### Identifier

To set criteria for bulk edit using **Identifier**, follow these steps: 

 1. In the **Set Criteria** pane, select the **Identifier** button.
 2. Select **Users** under **Record types**.
 3. Select the record identifier type from the  **Select record identifier** drop-down menu.
 4. The **record identifiers** for Users include:

 * **User UUIDs**
 * **User barcodes**
 * **External IDs**
 * **Usernames**
 5. **Drag and drop** your .csv file into the **Select a file with record identifiers** box, or click **or choose file** to upload the .csv file from your computer.

### Query

The **Query** function in the Bulk Edit app allows the user to build a query to identify records for bulk edit. 

To set criteria for bulk edit using **Query**, follow these steps: 

1. In the **Set Criteria** pane, click on the **Query** tab.
2. Select **Users** under **Record types**.
3. Click the **Build query** button to open the **Build query** modal.
4. Select a **Field** from the *Select field* drop-down menu or filter the selection by typing the field in the *Filter options list* text box.
5. Select an **Operator** from the *Select operator* drop-down list. The operators available for selection are based on the Field. 

 *  ==: Field equals selected or input Value.
 *  !=:  Field does not equal selected or input Value.
 *  Contains: Field appears in selected or input Value.
 *  Starts: Field starts with selected or input Value.
 *  \>: Field is greater than the selected or input Value.
 *  <: Field is less than the selected or input Value.
 *  \>=: Field is greater than or equal to the selected or input Value.
 *  <=: Field is less than or equal to the selected or input Value.
 *  Is null/empty: Field is blank; it contains no data.
 6. Select a **Value** from the *Select value* drop-down list or type the value in the Value text box.  The Values available for selection are based on the Field and Operator.
 7. Click on the **+ icon** to add additional lines to the query; Click on the **trash can icon** to delete a line from the query. 
 8. Once a query is built, it must be tested before the query can be run and saved. Click the **Test query** button to run the query and display a preview of matched records. The query string can be edited in the **Query string** field. If edited, another Test query must be done.
 9. If the Test query is successful, click the **Run query** button to run the query and preview the matched records in the **Bulk edit query** modal.


### Preview matched records

If the **Identifier** method is used to identify records for bulk edit, the number of records matched and the filename display at the top of the **Bulk edit** modal. 

If the **Query** method is used to identify records for bulk edit, a Test query displays the Query string and number of records retrieved at the top of the **Build query** modal. 

 If the **Query** is run, the query and a preview of matched records display in the **Bulk edit query** modal. 


In either method, the following information appears in the **Preview of record matched** pane:


- **Username.** The username of the user.
- **Barcode.** The barcode from the user record.
- **Status.** The status of the user.
- **Patron group.** The patron group assigned to the user. 
- **Last name.** The last name of the user.
- **First name.** The first name of the user.


To include or remove record identifier columns in the preview pane, click **Actions \> Show columns**, check the box next to the name of the record identifier to include as a column in the preview; or uncheck the box next to the name of the record identifier to remove the column from the preview.


### Download matched records


To download the matched records as a .csv file, follow these steps:


1. In the **Preview** pane, click **Actions \> Download matched records (CSV)**.
2. Depending on the web browser settings, the .csv file may be opened and/or saved. 


### Download errors


If there are errors in the matched records, a message indicating the filename, number of entries, number of records matched, and number of errors display in the **Errors** section. 


Any errors display in a two-column table in the **Errors** section.

### Start bulk edit 

The data in the **Email**, **Expiration date**, and **Patron group** fields of matched user records can be replaced with new data by using the Bulk edit approach. Bulk edit may be performed on each of these fields individually or simultaneously. To bulk edit all three fields simultaneously, click the **+ icon** at the end of the row to add another bulk edit option. 

To start a bulk edit, follow these steps:

1. In the **Preview** pane, click **Actions > Start bulk edit**. The number of matched records and the filename of the .csv file display at the top of the **Bulk edit** window.
2. In the **Bulk edits** section, select **Email**, **Expiration Date**, or **Patron Group**.
 - For **Email**, bulk edit performs a find and replace in the email address field of the matched records. Thus, the **Actions** available are **Find (full field search)** and **Replace with** . Type the current data (text) in the **Find (full field search)** box. Type the new data (text) in the **Replace with** box. 
 - For **Expiration date**, bulk edit replaces the date in the Expiration date of the matched records. Thus, the **Actions** available are limited to **Replace with**.  Type the new expiration date in MM/DD/YYYY format in the **Data** box. 
 - For **Patron group**, bulk edit replaces the Patron group data in the matched records. Thus, the **Actions** available are limited to **Replace with**. Select the new Patron group from the **Data** drop-down menu. 
3. Click the **Confirm changes** button.
4. A message appears in the **Are you sure?**modal. The message *(Number of) records will be changed if the Commit changes button is clicked. You may choose Download preview to review all changes prior to saving.* A **Preview of records to be changed** is also displayed.
 - Click **Keep editing** to return to the Bulk edit window.
 - Click **Download preview** to download a .csv file of the proposed changes. 
 - Click **Commit changes** to run the bulk edit.
5. When the bulk edit is complete, a confirmation message, *(Number of) records have been successfully changed*, appears in the **Bulk edit** window. 
6. To change the column headings in the **Preview of record changed** table, click **Actions** and select or deselect the fields in the **Show columns** list as appropriate.
7. To download a .csv file of changed records, click **Actions > Download changed records (CSV)**. 


### Start bulk edit (Local)

The **Bulk edit (Local)** function allows the user to perform a bulk edit on records edited locally (external to FOLIO) by uploading a .csv file of the changed, or edited, records. 

Any field in matching user records can be changed by using the Bulk edit (Local) approach.

Note that Microsoft Excel processes .csv files in ways that may change data unexpectedly, especially date and time fields. Reviewing the .csv data in a text editor helps ensure that no unexpected changes are made to records with **Bulk edit (Local)**.

To use **Bulk edit (Local)** approach to apply changes to records, follow these steps: 

1. In the **Set criteria** pane, select Users as the **Record type** and select the appropriate **Record identifier**: User UUIDs, User barcodes, External IDs, or Usernames.
2. Upload a .csv file with the selected Record identifier by either using the **Drag and drop** option or clicking the **Choose file** button.
3. Select **Actions \> Download matched records (CSV)** to download a .csv file of matched user records; or select **Actions \> Download errors (CSV)** to download a .csv file of records that did not match your selected record identifier. 
4. Edit the downloaded .csv file and make changes to the user records in the file itself. Save the edited .csv file to your computer.
5. Select **Actions \> Start bulk edit (Local)**. 
6. In the **Bulk edit** window, **Drag and drop** the .csv file into the **Upload CSV file with edited records** box, or click **or choose file** to upload the .csv file from your computer. If the .csv file is uploaded successfully, the confirmation message, *(Name of File).csv successfully uploaded*, displays in a new window.
7. Click **Next**. The warning message, *(Number of) records will be updated if the **Commit changes** button is clicked.* appears in a new window.
8. Click **Commit changes**. Bulk edit will apply the local changes to the records in FOLIO.
