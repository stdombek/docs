The Bulk Edit app allows a user to apply changes to multiple Inventory or User records simultaneously. 


## Permissions

The permissions listed below allow you to interact with the Bulk Edit app and determine what you can or cannot do within the app. Bulk edit permissions, combined with other functional app permissions, allow a user to access specific areas of the Bulk Edit app. Depending on how your library runs bulk edit jobs, users may also need permissions in other modules, such as Export Manager, Inventory, Users, and Settings. 

Permissions are assigned to users in the Users app. If none of the Bulk edit permissions are assigned to a user, they are unable to see the Bulk Edit app or any related information. 
See [Users \> Assign or unassign permissions](../users/#assign-or-unassign-permissions) for more information. 

The following are the permissions for the Bulk edit app:

- **Bulk edit: Can build query**: This permission allows the user to build and test a query, and preview matched records in the Bulk edit app. 
- **Bulk edit: Can view logs** This permission allows the user to download and view logs in the Bulk Edit app.
- **Bulk edit: In app - Edit inventory records** This permission allows the user to edit a field in multiple inventory records in the Bulk Edit app.
- **Bulk edit: In app - Edit user records**. This permission allows the user to edit a field in multiple user records in the Bulk edit app. 
- **Bulk edit: In app - View inventory records** This permission allows the user to view a list of identified inventory records in the Bulk Edit app. 
- **Bulk edit: Local - Edit user records** This permission allows the user to edit a field in multiple identified user records in the Bulk Edit app by uploading a .csv file.
- **Bulk edit: Local - View user records** This permission allows the user to view a list of identified user records in Bulk Edit by uploading a .csv file.


## Identify records for bulk edit

The Bulk edit app provides two methods for setting criteria and identifying records for bulk edit: **Identifier** and **Query**.  In either method, the **Record identifiers** or **Fields** available for selection are based on the **Record type**.


### Identifier

The **Identifier** approach allows the user to set criteria for the bulk edit by uploading a list of record identifiers from a .csv file. 

To set criteria for bulk edit using **Identifier**: 

1. In the **Set Criteria** pane, select the **Identifier** button.
2. Select the **Record type**. The following **Record types** are available for bulk edit:
   
   - Inventory - holdings
   - Inventory - instances
   - Inventory - items
   - Users

     
4. Select the **Record identifier** from the **Select record identifier** drop-down menu. [Record identifiers available for selection](#record-identifiers-by-record-type) are based on the Record type.
5. **Drag and drop** your .csv file into the **Select a file with record identifiers** box, or click **or choose file** to upload the .csv file from your computer. Only .csv files containing one column of record identifiers are accepted for upload in the Bulk edit app. If the .csv file contains more than one column, the upload will not be successful and a *Something went wrong* message displays. 

#### Record identifiers by record type

In the **Identifier** method, the **Record identifiers** available for selection are based on the selected **Record type**. 

| Record Type | Record identifier | 
| :-----: | :-----: |  
| *Inventory - holdings* | Holdings UUIDs | 
| *Inventory - holdings* | Holdings HRIDs |
| *Inventory - holdings* | Instance HRIDs |
| *Inventory - holdings* | Item barcodes |

| *Inventory - instances* | Instance HRIDs |
| *Inventory - items* | Item barcodes |

| *Inventory - items* | Item accession numbers |
| *Users* | User UUIDs |
| *Users* | User Barcodes |
| *Users* | External IDs |
| *Users* | Usernames |


### Query

The **Query** function in the Bulk Edit app allows the user to build a query to identify records for bulk edit. The **Fields** available for building a query are based on the selected **Record type**.

3. Click the **Build query** button to open the **Build query** modal.
4. Select a **Field** from the *Select field* drop-down menu or filter the selection by typing the field in the *Filter options list* text box. The **Fields** available for selection are based on the **Record type**. See [Fields by Record Type](#fields-by-record-type) for more information.  

5. Select an **Operator** from the *Select operator* drop-down list. The **Operators** available for selection are based on the **Field**. 

| Operator | Meaning |

7. Click on the **+ icon** to add additional lines to the query or click on the **trash can icon** to delete a line from the query.
8. Once a query is built, it must be tested before the query can be run and saved. Click the **Test query** button to run the query and display a preview of matched records. The query string can be edited in the **Query string** field. If edited, another Test query must be done.
9. If the Test query is successful, click the **Run query** button to run the query and preview the matched records in the **Bulk edit query** modal.

### Preview matched records

If the **Identifier** method is used to identify records for bulk edit, the number of records matched and the filename display at the top of the **Bulk edit** modal. 

If the **Query** method is used to identify records for bulk edit, a **Test query** displays the query string and number of matched records at the top of the **Build query** modal. If the query is run, the **Query** and a preview of matched records display in the **Bulk edit query** modal. 

To add or remove **Field** columns in the preview pane:

The **Start bulk edit (Local)** function allows the user to perform a bulk edit on user records edited locally (external to FOLIO) by uploading a .csv file of the changed, or edited, user records. Any and all fields in user records can be changed using the **Bulk edit (Local)** approach.

To perform bulk edit on user records using the **Start bulk edit (Local)** approach: 

1. After identifying user records, click **Actions \> Download matched records (CSV)** to download a .csv file of the matched user records; or select **Actions \> Download errors (CSV)** to download a .csv file of records that did not match your selected record identifier.
2. Edit the downloaded .csv file and make changes to the user records in the file itself. Save the edited .csv file to your computer.
3. Click **Actions \> Start bulk edit (Local)**.
4. In the **Bulk edit** window, **Drag and drop** the .csv file into the **Upload CSV file with edited records** box, or click **or choose file** to upload the .csv file from your computer. If the .csv file is uploaded successfully, the confirmation message, *(Name of File).csv successfully uploaded*, displays in a new window.
5. Click **Next**. The warning message, *(Number of) records will be updated if the **Commit changes** button is clicked.* appears in a new window.
6. Click **Commit changes**. Bulk edit will apply and save the local changes to the matched user records in FOLIO.

### Preview bulk edit logs
