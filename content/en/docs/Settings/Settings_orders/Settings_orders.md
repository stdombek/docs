The Orders section of the Settings app is where you establish behavior around approving and opening orders, your closing order reasons, how orders interact with the Inventory app, order templates, order lines limits, PO number settings, and custom fields.


## Permissions

In order to interact with order settings, a user needs to be assigned the following permissions:


*   **Settings (Orders): Can create, edit, view and delete custom fields.**  This permission allows the user to create, edit, view and delete custom fields in Settings > Orders.
*   **Settings (Orders): Can create, edit, view custom fields.**  This permission allows the user to create, edit, and view custom fields in Settings > Orders.
*   **Settings (Orders): Can view custom fields.**  This permission allows the user to view custom fields in Settings > Orders.

## Settings > Orders > General > Approvals

If you want to require approval to open orders, select **“Approval required” to open orders**. When selected, an additional step between Pending and Open is added. A user with the appropriate permission has to approve the order via a separate action or by checking an approval box on the order record. Once the order is approved, the date and time of the approval is captured, along with the username of the person who made the approval. If this setting is not activated, the approval date and time will match the date and time that the order was opened. For more information, see [Approving an order](../acquisitions/orders/#approving-an-order).


## Settings > Orders >  General > Closing purchase order reasons

Use this setting to configure the reasons for an order closure. FOLIO provides default closing purchase order reasons, which cannot be edited or deleted, but you can add reasons to track closures specific to your library.


### Creating a closing purchase order reason

## Settings > Orders > General > Order templates

Use this setting to configure your order templates. Order templates can be used to populate consistent information that you may always fill out when ordering from a specific vendor, for example. Note: Any order templates you create are shared among all users who have permission to create orders.

Order templates contain the same fields found in order records but also include order line information, which is automatically applied to any order lines added to the order record that uses the order template.


### Creating an order template

To create a new order template, follow the steps below.  To hide a field from view during order creation, click on the eye icon beside the field name.  The eye icon will display an angled slash mark to indicate that the field will be hidden.  When the user creates a new order and selects the template, only the fields with the eye turned on will display. Hidden fields can be restored to view by users with permission to view hidden fields. Note: Template name is the only required field for a new order template.

1. Click **New**.

2. Click **Hide all eligible fields** to turn off visibility for all fields that can be hidden during order creation.  You can then turn on only the fields that you want to display by unselecting the eye icon beside those fields.

3. Fill in information as needed for the remaining order creation fields. Follow the instructions under [Creating an order](../acquisitions/orders/#creating-an-order) for more information. Click on the eye icon to hide fields as needed.

3. Click **Save**. A confirmation message appears and the template is saved.


### Editing an order template

1. Select the order template you want to edit.

2. In the order template window, select **Actions > Edit**.

3. Edit the order template.

4. Click **Save**. A confirmation message appears and the template is updated.


### Deleting an order template

1. Select the order template you want to delete.

2. In the order template window, select **Actions > Delete.**

3. In the **Delete template** dialog, click **Delete**. A confirmation message appears and the template is deleted.


## Settings > Orders > General > Purchase order lines limit

Use this setting to limit the number of order lines that you can add to an order. If you do not want to have a limit, enter **999**. The default value is equal to the minimum order lines limit of 1. If you change tha value in this setting, click **Save** to capture the update.


## Settings > Orders > General > Opening purchase orders

If you want to allow users the option to save and open a purchase order in the same step, select **Allow save and open purchase order when creating or editing a purchase order line.**

If you want to turn off FOLIO's ability to check for potential duplicate purchase order lines, check **Disable duplicate check that occurs when opening orders and saving purchase order lines**. When this setting is unchecked, FOLIO will scan for potential duplicate purchase order lines based on the title and product IDs entered on the purchase order line. If a potential duplicate is found, staff will see a popup window notifying them of potential duplication, with further information about the detected duplicate purchase order lines. Staff may choose to proceed with creation and opening of their purchase order or may cancel the action.

## Settings > Orders > Inventory interaction > Instance matching

When a library opts to create at least an instance record corresponding to their purchase order line, staff may choose to link to an existing instance record or create a new record. If creating an instance record, the default FOLIO behavior is to first search instances to find a match for one or more of the product IDs provided on the purchase order line. Matching is based on both the ID and the type. If a matching product ID and type is found in Inventory, that instance will be linked to the purchase order line and the system will not create a new instance for that record. If no matches are found, the system will create a new instance record and link the purchase order line to that instance.

A library may choose to select the **Disable instance matching** checkbox. When activated, a new instance will always be created if the library opts to create Inventory records when they open the order, except when manully linked to an instance record.


## Settings > Orders > Inventory interaction > Inventory interactions defaults

Use this setting to determine how materials you are ordering interact with the Inventory app. The settings you select here determine the default interaction based on the Order format (Electronic, Physical, P/E Mix, or Other) you select for the order line item. The interactions you select can be changed when you add or edit an order line, in the Create inventory field of the Physical resource or E-resource details section of the order line, if needed. The inventory interactions are initiated when the order is opened.

There are four default interactions you can select:


*   **Instance, holdings, item.** Once the order is opened, an instance, holdings, and item are found or created in the Inventory app.
*   **Instance.** Once the order is opened, an instance is found or created in the Inventory app.
*   **Instance, holdings.** Once the order is opened, an instance and holdings are found or created in the Inventory app.
*   **None.** Nothing is found or created in the Inventory app.


## Settings > Orders > Inventory interaction > Instance status

Use this setting to determine the instance status that is assigned to the instances that are created through opening an order. Note: If you have not selected a default, then you may encounter problems when trying to receive an item or when you close an order.

For information on managing instance status values, see [Settings > Inventory > Instances > Instance status types](../settings/settings_inventory/settings_inventory/#settings--inventory--instance-status-types).


## Settings > Orders > Inventory interaction > Instance type

Use this setting to determine the instance resource type that is assigned to the instances that are created through opening an order. Note: If you have not selected a default, then you may encounter problems when trying to open an order that should create a new instance.

For information on managing instance type values, see [Settings > Inventory > Instances > Resource types](../settings/settings_inventory/settings_inventory/#settings--inventory--resource-types).


## Settings > Orders > Inventory interaction > Loan type

Use this setting to determine the loan type that is assigned to the items that are created through opening an order. Note: If you have not selected a default, then you will not be able to open orders where new items are being created. For information on managing loan type values, see [Settings > Inventory > Loan types](../settings/settings_inventory/settings_inventory/#settings--inventory--loan-types).
